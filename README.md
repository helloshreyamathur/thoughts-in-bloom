# Thoughts in Bloom

A living digital garden where ideas grow and connect over time.

## 1. Core Concept & Purpose
- Build a living digital garden of thoughts—a space where ideas grow and connect over time
- Capture daily learnings from conversations, observations, and ideas I want to remember
- Form, expand, and refine my point of view as thoughts accumulate
- Watch thoughts influence and shape my perspective

## 2. Input & Capture
- Drop in a thought and watch it connect to other thoughts over time
- Save thoughts and instantly see them placed next to similar past ideas
- Log when each thought was written
- Tag thoughts with metadata (people, themes, days)

## 3. Visualization & Interface Modes
- **myMind Mode**: Clean cards with airy, dreamy, light aesthetic
- **Obsidian Mode**: Constellation view showing connections
- Toggle between both modes whenever I need to see connections
- Watch new thoughts slide into place with dynamic reorganization
- Click clusters to reveal underlying patterns or themes that tie ideas together

## 4. Connection & Intelligence
- Automatically surface insights, patterns, and connections across everything I've written
- See how thoughts connect over time
- Reveal patterns that tie ideas together
- Drag two thoughts together and merge them into an emerging point of view

## 5. Filtering & Navigation
- Filter my garden by people, themes, or days
- Tag a thought with a person's name and automatically see how that person has shaped my thinking
- Browse through different lenses of my thinking

## 6. Analytics & Insights
- Statistics on what is shaping my point of view the most
- Track sources: ideas, conversations, readings, observations, media, etc.
- Understand influence patterns across my garden

## 7. Technical Requirements
- Website/webapp format
- Combine the simplicity and visual style of myMind with the depth and linking power of Obsidian
- Dynamic, evolving layout system that reorganizes as my thinking evolves
